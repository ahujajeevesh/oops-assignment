        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming style that organizes code around objects, rather than functions and logic.\n",
        "-  Objects are units that contain data and functions, and are used to model systems.\n",
        "- Examples of OOP Manufacturing system simulation software, Mobile applications, and Programs for design.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "- class is a template for creating objects. Classes define the properties and behaviors of objects, and allow programmers to create objects that behave in a consistent way.\n",
        "- Classes can be used to support inheritance, which is a mechanism for reusing code.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Object is a unit of code that represents a specific aspect of a program. Objects are the basic building blocks of OOP and are used to model systems.\n",
        "- Objects can represent physical entities, like people, cars, or products.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Encapsulation is a Python technique for combining data and functions into a\n",
        "single object.\n",
        "- Encapsulation refers to the\n",
        "broad concealment of an object's internal representation from areas outside of its specification.\n",
        "- Abstraction is a key idea in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to describe complicated systems by hiding unneeded details and exposing just essential aspects.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, in Python are special reserved methods that are surrounded by double underscores (i.e., __method__).\n",
        "-  These methods allow you to define how\n",
        "instances of your classes behave when they are used with built-in Python functions or operators.\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation.\n",
        "-  This mechanism enables code reuse, facilitates the creation of a hierarchy of classes, and promotes modularity in software design.\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism refers to an object's capacity to assume several forms.\n",
        "- Polymorphism enables us to carry out a single activity in a variety of ways\n",
        "- From the Greek words poly (many) and morphism (forms), we get polymorphism.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by using access modifiers to limit access to a class's variables and methods.\n",
        "- This is done by bundling the data and methods into a single unit, or class.\n",
        " - Use access modifiers like public, private, and protected.\n",
        " - Use single and double underscores to achieve the same effect as access modifiers.\n",
        " - Use property decorators.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method that automatically initializes an object when it's created.\n",
        "- The primary constructor is called __init__().\n",
        "The constructor is automatically called when an object of a class is instantiated .\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",
        "- They can access or modify class state that applies across all instances of the class. Class methods are defined using the\n",
        "@classmethod decorator.\n",
        "- Static methods are methods that belong to the class and don't access or modify class or instance state. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-  Method overloading is the practice of invoking the same method more than\n",
        "once with different parameters.\n",
        "-  Even if you overload the method, Python only takes into account the most recent definition. If you overload a method in Python, a\n",
        "TypeError will be raised.\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "-  Method overriding is the process of providing a different\n",
        "implementation for a method that is already defined in the superclass within a subclass.\n",
        "-  When a method is overridden, the subclass implements the method in its own way, which overrides the behaviour defined in the superclass. The subclass can then alter or expand the functionality of\n",
        "the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The Python property decorator makes attributes in a class act like read-only properties. Essentially, it lets you access methods as if they were attributes, without needing to write parentheses.\n",
        "- Decorators are typically applied to functions, and they play a crucial role in enhancing or modifying the behavior of functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP ?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows for easy extension of functionality by creating new classes that inherit from existing ones and override methods to provide specific behavior.\n",
        "- By using a single method name for different object types, developers can write code once and use it across different classes, minimizing code duplication.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "- Abstract classes allow us to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface while still allowing the subclasses to provide specific implementations.\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- OOP ensures modularity, reusability, and enhanced code structure by organising design around objects rather than functions.\n",
        "- OOP hides the internal implementation of objects, which controls access to data and promotes code reusability.\n",
        "- OOP allows developers to break down complex problems into self-contained units.\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variables are useful for storing data that is shared among all instances of a class, such as constants or default values.\n",
        "-  Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance of a class, such as object properties.\n",
        "- Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block. Instance variables are created when an object is created with the use of the keyword 'new' and destroyed when the object is destroyed.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- One child class may inherit from several parent classes when there is multiple inheritance.\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance allows classes to inherit and combine the behavior of multiple parent classes, providing flexibility in designing complex class hierarchies.\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "- \"__str__\"=  This method is called when the str() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return a string representation of the object\n",
        "- '__repr__'= This method is called when the repr() function is used on an instance of the class. It should return an unambiguous string representation of the object, which can be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function is used to refer to the parent class or superclass. It allows you to call methods defined in the superclass from the subclass.\n",
        "- The super() is a built-in function that allows access to methods and properties of a parent or superclass from a child or subclass.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method exists to release any resources held by an object when that object is deleted.\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a powerful tool for managing resource cleanup when objects are destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @classmethod\n",
        " - Takes the class as the first parameter, cls\n",
        " - Can access and modify the class state .\n",
        " - Can be used to create objects of the class in a different way.\n",
        "- @staticmethod\n",
        " - Does not take any specific parameters.\n",
        " - Cannot access or modify the class state .\n",
        " - Can be used to define utility functions within the class's scope.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        " - Polymorphism, a child class method is allowed to have the same name as the class methods in the parent class. In inheritance, the methods belonging to the parent class are passed down to the child class.\n",
        " - The core mechanism for achieving polymorphism in inheritance is by overriding methods in the child class. This means defining a method with the same name as a method in the parent class, but with a different implementation tailored to the child class.\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        " -  Method chaining in Python an efficient approach that makes it possible to invoke multiple methods within an object using a single line of code.\n",
        " - It makes code shorter, more easily to read, and easy to understand, in addition to giving a quite natural way of coding successive operations on data or objects.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __call__ method in Python allows programmers to create callable objects, which can be called like functions.\n",
        " - Allows programmers to write classes where instances behave like functions.The main idea of __call__ method is to write a class and invoke it like a function. You can refer to it as callable object."
